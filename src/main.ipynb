This can be an important aspect of the automotive industry, as it allows companies to acquire inventory at a lower cost than buying cars individually. Wholesale transactions often involve negotiating bulk prices, arranging shipping and delivery, and managing paperwork and financing.\\n\\n_Tata Commercial Vehicles_: Tata commercial vehicles include small commercial vehicles & pickups (SCV & pickups), medium and heavy commercial vehicles, and intermediate light commercial vehicles and commercial vehicle passenger vehicles (CV passenger vehicles) manufactured under the Tata and Daewoo brands (and excludes vehicles manufactured under the Jaguar Land Rover brand).\\n\\n_Vahan Registration_: Vahan registration refers to registering a motor vehicle with the government’s Vahan database system. The Indian government uses this system to maintain a centralized record of all motor vehicles and their owners in the country.\\n\\nThe registration process involves submitting various documents, such as proof of ownership, insurance, and pollution control certificate, along with the required fees, to the area’s Regional Transport Office (RTO). Once the registration is complete, the vehicle is assigned a unique registration number and a registration certificate. This certificate proves that the vehicle has been registered with the government and is legally allowed to be driven on public roads.\\n\\n[Back To Table Of Contents](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/tata-motors-market-share/#TOP)\\n\\n_Tata Passenger Vehicles_: Tata passenger vehicles include passenger cars and utility vehicles manufactured under the Tata and Fiat brands (and excludes vehicles manufactured under the Jaguar Land Rover brand).\\n\\n_Heavy Goods and Motor Vehicles (HGV+MGV)_: Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) are large commercial vehicles transporting goods or materials over long distances.

They are typically used for transporting goods and materials over short to medium distances and are commonly seen on urban roads and highways. MGVs can come in various configurations, such as box vans, flatbed trucks, and refrigerated vehicles, and are often used by businesses for delivering goods to customers or transporting equipment and supplies between locations.\\n\\n_Light Goods Vehicles_: Light Goods Vehicles, also known as LCVs, are commercial vehicles designed to transport goods. They typically have a maximum weight of 3.5 tonnes and are smaller than heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). LCVs are commonly used by small businesses, tradespeople, and delivery companies for transporting goods and equipment. They are available in various types, including vans, pickup trucks, and small lorries.\\n\\n[Back To Table Of Contents](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/tata-motors-market-share/#TOP)\\n\\n_Passenger Cars_: Tata-branded passenger cars include the Tiago (compact), Tiago EV, and the Altroz (premium) in the hatchback category, and the Tigor, Tigor EV, Xpres T-EV (mid-size) in the sedan  \\ncategory.\\n\\n_Utility Vehicles_: Tata-branded utility vehicles include the Harrier, the Nexon, the Nexon (EV), Nexon EV Max, Punch, and Safari.\\n\\n_SCV & Pickup_: Tata Motors manufactures a variety of small Commercial Vehicles and pickup trucks (less than 3.5 tons).\\n\\nThis includes the Tata Ace, India’s first indigenously developed mini-truck, with a sub-1 ton payload with different fuel options (Diesel, CNG, Gasolene, EV), the Tata Intra (V10, V20, V30, V50) with varying options of payload and the Tata Yodha pickup range with single cab and double cab variants and 4X2 and 4X4 options including the 2-Ton payload variant.\\n\\n[Back To Table Of Contents](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/tata-motors-market-share/#TOP)\\n\\n_MHCV and ILCV_: Tata Motors manufactures a variety of MHCVs and ILCVs, which include trucks, tractors, tippers, multi-axle vehicles and pickups with GVWs (including payload) of between 3.5 tons and 55 tons.\\n\\nTata Motors also provides fully built solutions for special applications like garbage compactors, containers, tankers, reefers, and diesel bowsers to customers and various government organizations, including solutions related to national defense. In addition, through TDCV, Tata Motors manufactures a wide array of trucks ranging from 215 horsepower to 560 horsepower, including dump trucks, tractor-trailers, mixers, and cargo vehicles.\\n\\nTata’s signature product is the Prima range of trucks, which are sold in India and South Korea and exported to several countries in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The SIGNA range of new MHCV trucks launched in 2016 has been extended to several additional tractor and tipper variants.\\n\\nSimilarly, the newest addition to this portfolio—the Ultra range—now spans multiple tonnage points starting from 5-ton Light Commercial Vehicles (“LCV”) to 30-ton tractors.\\n\\n_CV Passenger Vehicles_: Tata Motors manufactures a variety of passenger carriers, including buses.
